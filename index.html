                    <h1>Texas Approved Defensive Driving Courses</h1>
                    <br />
                    <p>Take a National Safety Council court-approved course to receive one or both of the following benefits:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Ticket Dismissal Texas state law allows motorists to dismiss one traffic ticket every 12 months by taking a court-approved driver safety course, with the permission of the court.</li>
                        <li>Insurance Discount Some insurance companies will provide a discount (usually 10%) for three years on the liability portion of your auto insurance premiums if you provide proof of completion of a court-approved driver safety course.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>DDC 6-TX</h3>
                    <p>This six-hour course is approved by the Texas Region XIII Education Service Center to satisfy the requirement of the Driver Safety Program. Classes are available statewide and in English and Spanish.</p>

                    <h3>Younger Driver Program</h3>
                    <p>If you are under 25 years of age and have been sentenced by a judge to attend a younger driver course, the Alive at 25 program is the approved course. Alive at 25 is a highly interactive four-hour intervention program that focuses on drivers ages 15 to 24 â€” the group most likely to be involved in a fatal collision. Alive at 25 uses workbook exercises, group discussions, role playing and short lectures to help keep young drivers safe on the road.</p>
