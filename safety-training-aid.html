title: Austin Defensive Driving Training Aid
---

    <p>When driving is part of your
job duties, whether you are behind the wheel of a rental
vehicle, a van, a company car, or an eighteen-wheeler,
you are a professional driver. Most drivers can drive
around the block without incident, but it takes a dedicated
professional to drive perfectly for thousands of miles.
When professional drivers are at the controls of any
vehicle they should always remember that defensive
driving is a full-time job. They take the time to complete
pre-trip checklists and perform inspections that familiarize
the driver with the vehicle and identifies unsafe
mechanical conditions that may need repair.
The driving conditions of today’s roads and highways
demand a higher level of skill, knowledge, and decisionmaking
ability. A defensive driver is someone who looks
for the mistakes of other drivers; not merely a person who
has had the good fortune to avoid accidents.
Safety-conscious drivers:
• develop good habits and practice them continually;
• are prepared mentally and physically every time they
are behind the wheel;
• comply with all traffic laws and are courteous to
others;
• remember that speed, whether too slow or too fast,
kills;
• adapts their driving to the current driving conditions;
• maintain a safe distance from the vehicle in front of
them-one vehicle length for each 10 mph; and
• are aware of the vehicle’s limitations.
Defensive drivers:
• have foresight that gives them the ability to size up
traffic situations on the road ahead;
• start slowing down sooner and apply the brakes the
instant they see a hazard developing;
• apply the brakes gradually so they don’t spin or grind
to a stop so quickly that they risk a rear-end collision;
and
• anticipate the incorrect actions of other drivers in time
to take the actions necessary to prevent accidents.</p>
