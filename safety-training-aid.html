                    <p>When driving is part of your job duties, whether you are behind the wheel of a rental vehicle, a van, a company car, or an eighteen-wheeler, you are a professional driver. Most drivers can drive around the block without incident, but it takes a dedicated professional to drive perfectly for thousands of miles. When professional drivers are at the controls of any vehicle they should always remember that defensive driving is a full-time job. They take the time to complete pre-trip checklists and perform inspections that familiarize the driver with the vehicle and identifies unsafe mechanical conditions that may need repair. The driving conditions of today’s roads and highways demand a higher level of skill, knowledge, and decisionmaking ability. A defensive driver is someone who looks for the mistakes of other drivers; not merely a person who has had the good fortune to avoid accidents.</p>
                    <h3>Safety-conscious drivers:</h3>
                      <ul>
                        <li>develop good habits and practice them continually</li>
                        <li>are prepared mentally and physically every time they are behind the wheel</li>
                        <li>comply with all traffic laws and are courteous to others</li>
                        <li>remember that speed, whether too slow or too fast, kills</li>
                        <li>adapts their driving to the current driving conditions</li>
                        <li>maintain a safe distance from the vehicle in front of them-one vehicle length for each 10 mph</li>
                        <li>are aware of the vehicle’s limitations</li>
                      </ul>
                    <h3>Defensive drivers:</h3>
                      <ul>
                        <li>have foresight that gives them the ability to size up traffic situations on the road ahead</li>
                        <li>start slowing down sooner and apply the brakes the instant they see a hazard developing</li>
                        <li>apply the brakes gradually so they don’t spin or grind to a stop so quickly that they risk a rear-end collision</li>
                        <li>anticipate the incorrect actions of other drivers in time to take the actions necessary to prevent accidents.</li>
                      </ul>
